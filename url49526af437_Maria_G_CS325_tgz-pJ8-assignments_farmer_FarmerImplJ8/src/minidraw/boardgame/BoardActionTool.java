/** A tool to handle user interaction on board game figures.
 * Responsibility:
 * A) To visually move instances of BoardFigure objects.
 * B) To allow clicking immovable BoardFigures ("props").
 * C) To execute the board figure's 'performAction'
 * method upon mouse up.
 * 
 * Collaborators: BoardFigure.
 * 
 * Note: This tool will only move/click instances of
 * BoardFigure, for all other types of figures the tool
 * does nothing.
